# smail

Simplest email client for the terminal. It is just a telnet.


## Requirements

- a shell, I used zsh
- telnet, on my Mac I used brew to install it
- openssl


## Installing

Move to a folder in your `$PATH`.


## Configuring

Currently the credentials are harcoded in it, so edit the file
and replace. But I plan to add a prompt on the first run.


## Using

Run `smail`, it will prompt the needed information, like recipient,
subject and the body.


## Providers

Currently only Gmail.


## Why

Learning purposes.
